# Knight's Tour

An exercise in data structures and algorithms. 

### Goal

- To start from a block on the chessboard, and touch every tile with the knight piece.
- This problem normally uses recursion, but in this case will feature a linked-list based stack and an array based priority queue.

### Specifications

- Able to compute both using brute-force (may take up to 2 hours) or the Warnsdorff's Rule (usually less than 0 milliseconds)
- Allows the user to select either to use a linked-list stack or priority queue to hold the values
- Allows the user to replay the movements of the knight using an in-console representation
